# Shift Code

A shift code is where a message can be easily encoded and decoded using a code key. Each letter is moved forwards through the alphabet a set number of letters to be
represented by a new letter. 

I uesd this project to practise:
- string manipulation;
- if statements;
- loops (while and for);
- subprograms.
